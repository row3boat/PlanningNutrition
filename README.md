# PlanningNutrition

To run this, you do one of two things.
1) Install Android Studio, clone this git repo, and open in Android Studio.  This was run on Pixel 4A Emulator, but it should be cross-compatible with most generations.
2) If you have an android device, install the APK and download the JSON in this zip file.[PlanningNutritionInstall.zip](https://github.com/row3boat/PlanningNutrition/files/8748441/PlanningNutritionInstall.zip)
